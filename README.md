# http-framework

A web framework based purely on `require('http')`

## Motivation

`require('http')` is a web framework. All you need to add a few
  small modules that do one thing well when your building your
  web application route handlers.

This module aggregates and documents (with examples) a selection
  of small modules that can be used to achieve this goal.

I do not recommend you use this "framework". You should check
  out the small modules and use them directly. Use the list of
  examples here for inspiration.

## Examples

The examples are clones of [`express`][18] examples demonstrating
  how to author web apps without frameworks.

Credit for the applications goes to

 - @visionmedia & express maintainers

see [the examples folder][17]

## Modules

See the [`package.json`][19] dependencies hash for an example of
  many small modules used in the examples folder of this project.

For a complete list of [Modules check out the wiki][20]
